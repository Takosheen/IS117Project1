        <h2  id="repo"><br>Git Basics / Creating a Repository</h2>
        <p>
          A repository is where your committed files will live; they can contain multiple "branches"
          based on your needs such as collaborating with others.</p>

        <p>To make your initial repository go to <a href="https://github.com/new">this link</a> or hit "new" on the top
            left of your github homepage</p>

        <p> Navigate to your repository on the web and copy the link from the "clone or download" drop down. Drop this
          link under VCS>Git>Remotes.</p>

        <h2 id="commit"><br>Making Your First Commit</h2>

        <p> Assuming you want to upload your work to git; commit by using Ctrl+K or click "commit"
        under the VCS menu. Before committing you'll be able to check your settings and even have some errors checked for you.
        After making the commit you can "push" it  by using Ctrl+Shift+K or navigating to VSC>Git>Push on the webstorm
          tool bar.</p>

        <h2 id="branch"><br>Creating Branches / Intro to collaboration</h2>

        <p>The easiest way to create a branch in git is to navigate to your repo on the web and hitting the grey "Branch"
        dropdown and begin typing the name of you new branch, you can also do this through the Webstorm tool bar by navigating
          to VCS>Git>Branches and clicking "+New Branch". Here is where you can also "checkout" other branches in your repo
        and commit and push them to your hearts desire while not worrying about affecting other branches. However if you are
        working with others it is nice to leave useful comments for you commits so they can know what's going on :) .</p>

        <p>Just as important as making branches is knowing how to use them. In groups it's best to split up tasks so everyone's
        code is organized and doesn't interfere with each other. In single user applications you could just make different branches for
        anytime you would make a new file such as to not mess up your old one like maybe trying a new feature or having
          it revised by someone else.</p>

        <h2 id="master"><br>The Master Plan / Pull Requests :p</h2>
        <p>When you're done making more branches than a tree it's time to polish up and chose what goes into your creme de
        le creme, your <strong>master</strong> branch you should have a good idea of where to go with this if you've been keeping up
        with your commits and pull requests adding things to the master as you go. Most of the time you'll receive pull requests
        from your collaborators or you could do it yourself by using the new pull request drop down next to the branch drop down.
          Either way when following through with the request git will let you know what has changed and in most cases will let you
          know if you're about to break something. If all seems well you can proceed to merge your branches into your completed project
        and succesfully collaborate while maintaining most of your sanity.</p>
