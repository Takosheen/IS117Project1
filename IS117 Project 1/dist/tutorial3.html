        <h1><br>Step 1</h1>
        <p>
        Step 1 to the F layout is to create an image of how the website would be laid out, and how to make it pop out,
            especially to fit the shape of an 'F'.
        </p>
      <div class="zoom">
      <img src="img/f-layout2.jpg" alt="Picture of website">
      </div>
        <h1><br>Step 2</h1>
        <p>
            Step 2 to the F layout is to basically divide the content up into separate lines, paragraphs, as well as
            headlines in order to fit the 'F' layout. In a way, the content itself should literally look like an 'F',
            but it should not be abundantly clear. At the end of this tutorial, there will be a screenshot of how the tutorial
          should be read, from left to right, then back down, creating the "F" layout.
        </p>
      <p>In terms of coding, there should be certain headings already listed in a separate CSS sheet in order to establish
        the formatting and patterns of an F-layout on a website. Each paragraph, like this one is separated with "< p>" and
      ending with "< /p>", with no space.
      </p>
        <h1><br>Step 3</h1>
        <p>
            Step 3 to understanding the F layout itself through code, such as bolding and highlighting titles in order
            to make the rest of the content in that section pop out, as seen above.
        </p>
        <h1><br>Step 4</h1>
        <p>
            Step 4 should be consisting of touching it up and making sure that the content itself flows correctly, such
            as making sure that all the events or content is able to relate to one another without being too different,
            while staying similar.
